# my-turk
A tool driven approach to Mechanical Turk user experiments

## Descriptions
my-turk is a tool driven approach to Mechanical Turk user experiments. It uses amazons marketplace Mechanical Turk (MTurk) where individuals can engage a globally distributed workforce to perform tasks. One example task would be "Identify the car in this picture". To take it a step further you can use my-turk to redirect the workers to your own experiment environment (custom website). This enables you to use MTurk to do tasks like A/B Testing or usability tests. 

## Try it out
